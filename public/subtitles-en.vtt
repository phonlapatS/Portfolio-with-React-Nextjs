00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
Hello and welcome.
I'm Philipp Maier,

2
00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.880
a course developer
with Google Cloud,

3
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.320
and this is a brief tutorial

4
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.285
on using Qwiklabs
in this course.

5
00:00:07.285 --> 00:00:09.285
I'm about to show
you the interactive

6
00:00:09.285 --> 00:00:11.585
hands-on labs platform
called Qwiklabs,

7
00:00:11.585 --> 00:00:13.465
which is part of Google Cloud.

8
00:00:13.465 --> 00:00:15.480
Qwiklabs allows you to get

9
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.180
practical hands-on experience
with Google Cloud and

10
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.900
provisions you with Google
account credentials so that

11
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.170
you can access the Cloud
console at no cost.

12
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.930
The first step is to log into

13
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.040
Coursera in an incognito Window.

14
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.525
Depending on your browser,

15
00:00:29.525 --> 00:00:31.610
it might also be called
private browsing

16
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.370
or in private browsing.

17
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.030
Logging into Coursera from

18
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.230
a private Window
ensures that you don't

19
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.350
accidentally use your
own Google account

20
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.330
while accessing
the Cloud console.

21
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.790
We don't want you to get any

22
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.830
unexpected bills at
the end of the month.

23
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.070
Check out the links in
the download section of

24
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.090
this video for different
browser support articles.

25
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.330
Once logged into Coursera
using an incognito Window,

26
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.400
return to your course and go
to the lab activity page.

27
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.730
If prompted, you want to accept

28
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.020
the honor code and
enter your name.

29
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.075
Then click ''Open Tool'' to
open that lab in a new tab.

30
00:01:12.075 --> 00:01:13.980
Within this new tab,

31
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.950
click ''Start Lab'' and wait for

32
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.310
the connection details to
be displayed on the left.

33
00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.490
For each lab, you
will have a timer,

34
00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:25.820
as you can see here,

35
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.070
with the remaining access time.

36
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.170
Your lab will automatically
end when the timer runs out.

37
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.315
Now you want to click
Open Google Console,

38
00:01:36.315 --> 00:01:40.230
then sign in with
the username and

39
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.350
password provided in this
connection's detail page.

40
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.445
I'm going to grab the username
here and paste that in,

41
00:01:50.445 --> 00:01:53.240
and this is going to be
different for each lab,

42
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.680
and then also grab the password

43
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.015
and paste that in there as well.

44
00:01:58.015 --> 00:02:00.480
Now, Qwiklabs creates
a new account

45
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.620
for you each time
you launch a lab.

46
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.440
Therefore, you need
to click through

47
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.655
the initial account
setup Windows.

48
00:02:06.655 --> 00:02:08.290
It's telling me I have
a new account here,

49
00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.145
so I'm going to accept.

50
00:02:10.145 --> 00:02:13.695
It's asking for a backup;

51
00:02:13.695 --> 00:02:16.720
I don't need that; I'm
just going to confirm.

52
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.455
Once I am in the Cloud console,

53
00:02:22.455 --> 00:02:27.720
I'm also going to have to
accept terms and services.

54
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.380
Let's just wait for
that to load up,

55
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.990
and then once I'm
in the account,

56
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.560
I can verify that I'm
using the right project,

57
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.465
and I'll show you
how to do that.

58
00:02:40.465 --> 00:02:42.445
I'm just waiting for
the terms of service,

59
00:02:42.445 --> 00:02:46.865
agree and then continue.

60
00:02:46.865 --> 00:02:49.770
Up here, you can see

61
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.390
the current project
ID that I'm using.

62
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.730
It's a good thing to double
check that this project

63
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.455
ID actually matches what
you have in Qwiklabs.

64
00:02:58.455 --> 00:03:01.890
We can see that here that
this is the same project ID.

65
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.870
In some labs, you actually
have multiple project IDs and

66
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.070
maybe even multiple
users if you're

67
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.580
trying to do specific
sharing between users,

68
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.175
or adding or removing
permissions, and so on.

69
00:03:13.175 --> 00:03:15.670
Now I can also see that

70
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.490
my username in here is
not my actual email;

71
00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.570
this is the account that
Qwiklabs created for me.

72
00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.800
It's important to make sure
that these match, again,

73
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.725
the credentials that are in here

74
00:03:28.725 --> 00:03:32.825
so that you're not
using your own account.

75
00:03:32.825 --> 00:03:36.150
Now some labs track
your work within

76
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.275
the Qwiklabs provided
Google Cloud project.

77
00:03:39.275 --> 00:03:41.750
If this is enabled, you
will see a score in

78
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.315
the top right corner of
the Qwiklabs Window,

79
00:03:44.315 --> 00:03:46.375
as you can see here.

80
00:03:46.375 --> 00:03:50.335
Now your score increases
as objectives are met,

81
00:03:50.335 --> 00:03:52.270
and you can click
on the score to

82
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.235
view the individual
steps to be scored,

83
00:03:54.235 --> 00:03:55.910
as you can see here right now.

84
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.670
I'm going to go complete
these and then come back.

85
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.710
Now that I have
completed the lab,

86
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.250
I can see my score
has been updated,

87
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.140
and I'm ready to click

88
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.460
End Lab and then
confirm with Okay.

89
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.960
I can now give this
some feedback,

90
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.895
and once I click End Lab,

91
00:04:17.895 --> 00:04:20.070
the Qwiklabs'
provided project and

92
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.795
any resources within that
project will be deleted.

93
00:04:23.795 --> 00:04:27.930
I can now close the
Qwiklabs' lab page.

94
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.990
Here I'm on the lab page,

95
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.840
and if I can scroll up,

96
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.530
you'll see that I have
successfully completed the lab.

97
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.210
If I go to the grades
section of the course,

98
00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.535
you'll also see that I have
a full score for this lab.

99
00:04:44.535 --> 00:04:46.330
That's it for this tutorial.

100
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.900
Remember to launch Coursera in

101
00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.600
an incognito Window and use

102
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.270
the Qwiklabs
provided credentials

103
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.030
to sign into the Cloud console.

104
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.345
Good luck with the labs,

105
00:04:54.345 --> 00:04:56.890
and enjoy the rest
of this course.
